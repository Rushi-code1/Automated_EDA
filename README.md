# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Streamlit

This project provides an interactive web application using **Streamlit** for performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on any dataset. It includes various features such as visualizations, statistical summaries, outlier detection, and the generation of a detailed PDF report summarizing the analysis.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload CSV, Excel, JSON, or TXT files to analyze.
- **Data Understanding**: Provides basic insights about the dataset such as shape, data types, and a preview of the data.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Automatically handles missing values by imputing them with appropriate values (e.g., median for numeric columns, mode for categorical columns).
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removes duplicate rows in the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detects and reports outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualizes distributions of individual variables using histograms and boxplots.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explores relationships between two variables using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigates the relationships between multiple variables using pair plots, box plots grouped by categorical variables, and KMeans clustering.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Generates a PDF report with insights, visualizations, and recommendations for the next steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- fpdf

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn fpdf
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eda-streamlit-app.git
   cd eda-streamlit-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. Upload your dataset using the "Upload" button.
2. The application will automatically handle missing values, remove duplicates, and detect outliers.
3. Visualizations for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis will be generated.
4. You can interact with the visualizations and explore the data.
5. At the end of the analysis, a PDF report will be generated, which includes:
    - A summary of the dataset
    - Details about missing values, duplicates, and outliers
    - Visualizations for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
    - Suggestions for next steps, such as feature engineering or model building

## Example Output

The application generates a PDF report that includes:
- **Dataset Overview**: The shape, columns, and basic statistics of the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies any outliers in numerical columns using the IQR method.
- **Visualizations**: Displays histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and KMeans clustering results.
- **Suggestions**: Recommendations for the next steps in the data science workflow, including feature engineering and model building.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
6. Open a pull request.
